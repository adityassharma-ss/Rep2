This looks like a set of notes or a partial agenda for a project discussion, likely about deploying an AIOps platform for Takeda. I'll format it into a clearer, well-structured document, adding some likely interpretations and suggestions for further detail.
Takeda AIOps Platform Deployment - Project Brief
Date: July 7, 2025
Prepared For: Internal Project Team
1. Project Overview & Objectives
This document outlines key considerations and action items for the deployment of an AIOps platform for Takeda. The primary objective is to establish the necessary infrastructure, processes, and access mechanisms to support the platform's operation and integration with Takeda's existing systems.
2. Key Discussion Areas & Action Items
2.1. VDIC Access
 * Action: Secure necessary VDIC (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Client/Connection?) access for all involved team members.
 * Query: Clarify the specific type of VDIC access required and the process for obtaining it.
2.2. Runbook Understanding & Access
 * Action: Thoroughly understand the existing Takeda Runbook(s) to gather detailed operational and procedural information.
 * Specific Focus:
   * Identify details regarding Takeda's existing operational workflows.
   * Determine if similar applications have been previously deployed by Deloitte for Takeda, and leverage insights from those deployments.
 * Runbook Access:
   * Action: Raise requests for "Awel temaform" / "Jofuay Access" (likely specific Takeda internal systems or tools) and general Runbook access for Takeda.
   * Clarification: Verify the exact names and purpose of "Awel temaform" and "Jofuay Access."
2.3. Platform Deployment Requirements
 * Question: What are the precise requirements for deploying the AIOps platform? This should cover:
   * Technical specifications
   * Software dependencies
   * Environmental prerequisites
2.4. Resource Allocation & Planning
 * Question: What resources (human, computational, software licenses, etc.) are required for this deployment?
 * Key Aspects to Address:
   * Planning Workflow: Define the detailed workflow for the entire deployment process, including phases, tasks, and responsibilities.
   * Cost & Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive cost analysis for the platform deployment, including infrastructure, licensing, and personnel.
2.5. Consultations
 * Action: Consult with Faheeb and Tapan for any queries or insights related to the project. (Specific areas of their expertise should be identified if known).
3. Team Structure & Responsibilities
 * Overall Platform Development: The platform will be built by "cdvops kam" and "Applications team."
 * Independent Contributors: Aditya and [Your Name] will serve as independent contributors, focusing on the platform build.
 * Application Deployment: The Applications team will be responsible for deploying the actual AIOps applications onto the platform we build.
 * Roles:
   * No designated "Lead" or "Manager" for this specific platform build component, suggesting a collaborative, self-organizing team.
   * The team will consist of "dual contributors," indicating shared responsibility and expertise.
4. System Architecture & Access
 * Platform Deployment: The AIOps platform will be deployed across "Two platforms" (details needed on what these two platforms refer to â€“ e.g., production/staging, different cloud environments, etc.).
 * My Access: All personal access requirements should be routed through "ASK IT."
5. Next Steps
 * Schedule a detailed kick-off meeting to discuss this brief and assign specific owners for each action item.
 * Begin the process of requesting necessary access and documentation.
 * Start gathering information on platform deployment requirements and resource needs.
